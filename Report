# Computational Codicology via Thermal Diffusion
**Visualizing Material Anomalies in Lanten Religious Manuscripts**

---

## Abstract
This study investigates the materiality of 19th-century Vietnamese Yao (Lanten) religious manuscripts using the **vHeat** unsupervised vision model. By applying a heat-conduction metaphor to document analysis, we visualize and quantify material traces such as ink bleed-through, paper wear, and ritual-induced stains.

## 1. Introduction: The Materiality of Yao Manuscripts
The manuscripts of the **Indigo Yao (Kim Mun / Lanten)** function as the material foundation of a mobile transregional network. As noted by Jacob Cawthorne, these texts represent an **"active literacy"**, where manuscripts are continually copied, carried, and reinterpreted during ritual practice and migration.

## 2. Methodology: vHeat as a Codicological Tool
We introduce **vHeat** (accepted at CVPR 2025) as a low-cost, high-throughput approach to computational codicology. 

### The Physical Metaphor
The design of vHeat is inspired by heat conduction:
* **Ink Penetration**: Similar to heat diffusion through a medium.
* **Aging Stains**: Modeled as diffusion sources from pixels.
* **Efficiency**: Achieves a global receptive field for planar surfaces.

## 3. Case Study Analysis: Zhai duan (Wang) miyu

### A. Macro-level Distribution
* **U-Shaped Pattern**: Anomaly area percentages are highest at the opening and closing leaves due to handling and humidity.
* **Fiber Structure**: Inner pages (e.g., Pages 36, 30, 24) show high anomaly intensity but low area (< 2%), confirming a loose paper fiber structure.

### B. Intentional Layout vs. Degradation
* **Page 19**: Showed the highest **Pattern Complexity**. The heat distribution followed a regular frequency structure, indicating **deliberate layout design (talismanic grids)** rather than damage.

## 4. Conclusion
vHeat provides an accessible pathway for material study on a **single consumer-grade GPU**. Results must be interpreted in conjunction with specific codicological knowledge.
