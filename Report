# Computational Codicology via Thermal Diffusion
**Visualizing Material Anomalies in Lanten Religious Manuscripts**

---

## 📜 Abstract
This study investigates the materiality of 19th-century Vietnamese Yao (Lanten) religious manuscripts using the **vHeat** unsupervised vision model. By applying a heat-conduction metaphor to document analysis, we visualize and quantify material traces such as ink bleed-through, paper wear, and ritual-induced stains.

## 1. Introduction: The Materiality of Yao Manuscripts
Within the religious networks of the East and Southeast Asian highlands, the manuscripts of the **Indigo Yao (Kim Mun / Lanten)** function as more than doctrinal carriers; they are the material foundation of a mobile transregional network. 

As noted by Jacob Cawthorne, these texts represent an **"active literacy"** [^1], where manuscripts are continually copied, carried, and reinterpreted during ritual practice and migration [^2]. Consequently, physical traces like paper wear and stains are historical evidence of equal importance to the written content.

## 2. Methodology: vHeat as a Codicological Tool
We introduce **vHeat** (accepted at CVPR 2025) as a low-cost, high-throughput approach to computational codicology [^4].

### Why Heat Conduction?
The physical metaphor of heat diffusion shares clear mathematical similarities with:
* **Capillary Penetration**: How ink moves through porous paper.
* **Biological Spread**: The formation of mold and aging stains.
* **Material Interaction**: Modeling correlations across a planar surface efficiently.

### Visual Outputs
For each page of the manuscript *Zhai duan (Wang) miyu*, we generate:
1. **2D Feature Heatmap Overlay**: Precise localization of anomalies.
2. **3D Anomaly Terrain Map**: Translating material variation into perceptible height fluctuations.

## 3. Key Findings

### A. The "U-Shaped" Wear Pattern
Analysis across 94 pages reveals that anomaly area percentages display a pronounced **U-shaped pattern**. 
* **Cover & End Pages**: Exhibit the highest wear due to handling and environmental exposure.
* **Middle Section**: Remains comparatively stable.

### B. Intentional Layout vs. Damage (Page 19)
Page 19 showed the highest **Pattern Complexity** but low anomaly area. 
* **Observation**: The 3D terrain map showed a highly regular frequency structure.
* **Conclusion**: This was caused by **dense tabular lines and talismanic grids** (intentional design) rather than deterioration.

### C. Ink Properties & Ritual Use
* **Stroke Edges**: Page 36 preserves sharper stroke edges compared to the homogenized background of Page 30, reflecting differences in ink concentration or brush movement.
* **Ritual Stains**: Page 8 exhibits uneven distributions likely associated with grease stains or smudges from repeated handling during ritual performances.

## 4. Conclusion & Limitations
vHeat provides an accessible computational pathway for material studies, running efficiently on a **single consumer-grade GPU**. However, it may produce misinterpretations in cases of material heterogeneity caused by paper repairs. Thus, computational results must be interpreted in conjunction with specific codicological knowledge.
