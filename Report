# Computational Codicology via Thermal Diffusion
**Visualizing Material Anomalies in Lanten Religious Manuscripts**

---

## Abstract
This study investigates the materiality of 19th-century Vietnamese Yao (Lanten) religious manuscripts using the **vHeat** unsupervised vision model. By applying a heat-conduction metaphor to document analysis, we visualize and quantify material traces such as ink bleed-through, paper wear, and ritual-induced stains.

## 1. Introduction: The Materiality of Yao Manuscripts
Within the religious networks of the East and Southeast Asian highlands, the manuscripts of the **Indigo Yao (Kim Mun / Lanten)** function as more than doctrinal carriers; they are the material foundation of a mobile transregional network. 

As noted by Jacob Cawthorne, these texts represent an **"active literacy"**, where manuscripts are continually copied, carried, and reinterpreted during ritual practice and migration. Consequently, physical traces like paper wear and stains are historical evidence of equal importance to the written content.

## 2. Methodology: vHeat as a Codicological Tool
We introduce **vHeat** (accepted at CVPR 2025) as a low-cost, high-throughput approach to computational codicology.

### The Physical Metaphor
The design of vHeat is inspired by principles of heat conduction. In a codicological context, this offers strong interpretive potential:
* **Ink Penetration**: The diffusion of heat through a medium shares mathematical similarities with the capillary penetration of ink into porous paper.
* **Aging Stains**: The model approximates the spread of mold and the formation of aging stains by modeling pixels as sources of diffusion.
* **Efficiency**: It achieves a global receptive field while maintaining computational efficiency, approximating natural interactions on a planar surface.

### Quantitative Metrics
The study employs three key metrics across all ninety-four pages:
1. **Mean Anomaly Index**: Overall intensity of material deviation.
2. **Anomaly Area Percentage**: Total surface area affected by significant anomalies.
3. **Pattern Complexity**: Statistical variation (Standard Deviation) of the heatmap, reflecting texture regularity.

## 3. Case Study Analysis: Zhai duan (Wang) miyu

### A. Macro-level Distribution (The U-Shaped Pattern)
At the scale of the entire volume, the distribution of anomaly area percentages displays a pronounced **U-shaped pattern**. 
* **Opening and Closing Leaves**: Exhibit the highest anomaly percentages due to handling and humidity exposure.
* **Inner Pages**: Pages 36, 30, and 24 exhibit high Mean Anomaly Index values but low Area Percentages (< 2%), confirming the manuscript’s overall loose paper fiber structure.

### B. Intentional Layout vs. Degradation (Page 19)
Page 19 presented a methodologically significant profile: the highest **Pattern Complexity** in the manuscript but a low Anomaly Area Percentage. 
* **Findings**: The heat distribution followed a highly regular frequency structure.
* **Interpretation**: Reference to the original image revealed dense tabular lines and talismanic grid structures, indicating that the model captures **deliberate layout design** rather than damage.

### C. Stroke Edge and Ritual Use
* **Stroke Sharpness**: Page 36 preserves sharper stroke edges (higher Pattern Complexity) compared to the homogenized background of Page 30.
* **Ritual Handling**: Page 8 exhibits a distinctly uneven anomaly distribution, likely associated with grease stains or smudges left by repeated handling during ritual performance.

## 4. Conclusion
vHeat provides an accessible computational pathway for the material study of premodern books, running efficiently on a **single consumer-grade GPU**. While it lowers the threshold for computational codicology, results must always be interpreted in conjunction with specific codicological knowledge and material context.
